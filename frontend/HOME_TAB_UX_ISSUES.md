# Home Tab UX Issues Analysis

**Date**: December 10, 2024  
**Status**: Critical Issues Identified  
**Testing Method**: Playwright automated testing with visual screenshots  

## Executive Summary

The Home tab currently has multiple critical UX issues that make the chat interface nearly unusable. The most severe problem is that user messages are completely missing from the conversation display, breaking the fundamental chat experience.

## Testing Results

### Screenshots Captured
1. `home-tab-initial-state.png` - Clean initial state
2. `home-tab-with-typed-message.png` - User typing message
3. `home-tab-loading-state.png` - AI processing state
4. `home-tab-conversation-developed.png` - Multiple message conversation
5. `home-tab-with-flashcard.png` - Component integration
6. `home-tab-mobile-with-flashcard.png` - Mobile responsive test

### User Flows Tested
- âœ… Typing and sending messages
- âœ… Quick action buttons (Show Progress, Get Help, What's Next, Review Concepts)
- âœ… Tab switching behavior
- âœ… Loading states and error handling
- âœ… Mobile responsive design
- âœ… Component integration (flashcards)

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
