This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server, navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port indicated in your terminal if 3000 is in use) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Note on Directory Structure

You may notice a `frontend/frontend/` subdirectory. This appears to be a development artifact or remnant. Developers should primarily work within the main `frontend/` directory and treat `frontend/frontend/` as an ignored item. Attempts to remove this nested directory have been unsuccessful due to limitations encountered with the available development tools.
