## Project Structure

The project is organized as a Next.js application with the following structure:

- **`src/`**: Application source code
  - `app/`: Next.js app directory with pages and layouts
  - `components/`: Reusable React components
  - `features/`: Feature-based components and logic
  - `lib/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `validation/`: Input validation and schemas
- **`public/`**: Static assets and resources
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation
