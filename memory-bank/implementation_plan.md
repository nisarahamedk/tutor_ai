*   **Phase 3: Rich Component Implementation and Advanced Interactivity**
*   **Phase 4: Learning Path Orchestration and Personalization**
*   **Phase 5: Testing, Deployment, and Iteration**

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Basic Chat (Estimated Time: 4-6 weeks)

    *   Basic frontend chat interface.
    *   Backend API for message handling.
    *   Temporal.io setup for managing chat sessions.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Frontend (React):**
        *   Set up React project structure.
        *   Implement basic chat UI (message display, input field).
        *   Integrate AG-UI client for basic WebSocket/SSE communication.
    *   **Backend (FastAPI):**
        *   Set up FastAPI project.
        *   Develop API endpoints for receiving and sending chat messages.
        *   Integrate AG-UI server for handling frontend connections.
        *   Integrate Supabase for basic user authentication and session management.
        *   Set up Supabase project and configure database schemas.
    *   **Temporal.io:**
        *   Set up a local Temporal.io development environment (or Temporal Cloud account).
        *   Define a simple Temporal workflow for a chat session (e.g., persisting chat history references or critical session data not primarily stored in Supabase, if any).
        *   Integrate Temporal SDK with the FastAPI backend to start and interact with chat session workflows.
    *   **Infrastructure:**
        *   Set up Git repository.
        *   Define initial CI/CD pipeline (e.g., for linting, basic tests).
        *   Containerize backend application (Docker).

### Phase 2: AI Agent Integration and Basic Tutoring Logic (Estimated Time: 6-8 weeks)

*   **Goal:** Integrate AI agents and implement rudimentary tutoring capabilities.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   AI agent can respond to simple user queries.
    *   Basic content delivery by the AI agent.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **AI Agents:**
        *   Choose an initial AI agent framework (e.g., LangGraph or CrewAI).
        *   Develop a simple AI agent that can process text input and generate text responses.
        *   Integrate the agent with the backend via AG-UI (or directly if AG-UI handles the routing).
        *   Connect the agent to an LLM for basic NLU/NLG.
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Modify Temporal workflows to include activities that call the AI agent.
        *   Pass user messages from chat sessions to the AI agent via Temporal activities.
        *   Relay agent responses back to the frontend.
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Display responses from the AI agent in the chat interface.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Define a small, initial set of learning content for basic tutoring.

### Phase 3: Rich Component Implementation and Advanced Interactivity (Estimated Time: 6-8 weeks)

*   **Goal:** Enhance the chat interface with rich interactive components as described in the PRD.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   Several rich components (e.g., multiple-choice questions, sliders, interactive cards) are usable in the chat.
    *   AI agent can request the use of specific rich components.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Design and implement a library of reusable rich React components (e.g., skill sliders, topic buttons, code snippet evaluators, progress visualizers).
        *   Extend AG-UI client to handle events related to rich components (e.g., user interaction with a component).
        *   Dynamically render rich components based on instructions from the backend/AI agent.
    *   **Backend (AG-UI & AI Agents):**
        *   Define AG-UI event structures for invoking and interacting with rich components.
        *   Enable AI agents to decide which rich component is appropriate for a given interaction.
        *   Modify AI agents to send messages/events that instruct the frontend to display specific rich components with certain configurations.
        *   Process data submitted by users through these rich components.
    *   **Temporal Workflows:**
        *   Update workflows to manage state related to rich component interactions.

### Phase 4: Learning Path Orchestration and Personalization (Estimated Time: 8-10 weeks)

*   **Goal:** Implement adaptive learning paths and personalize the learning experience.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   Users can embark on predefined learning tracks.
    *   The system adapts content and assessments based on user performance.
    *   AI agent provides more sophisticated guidance and support.
*   **Key Tasks:**
    *   **AI Agents & Backend:**
        *   Develop logic for defining and managing learning tracks (sequences of lessons, assessments, activities).
        *   Implement algorithms for adaptive learning (e.g., adjusting difficulty, recommending next steps based on progress).
        *   Enhance AI agents to guide users through learning tracks.
    *   **Temporal.io:**
        *   Design and implement more complex Temporal workflows to manage entire learning tracks for each user.
        *   Use Temporal to track user progress, manage state across multiple sessions, and orchestrate different learning activities (e.g., lessons, quizzes, projects).
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Implement UI elements for discovering and navigating learning tracks (e.g., interactive cards/carousels as per PRD).
        *   Display progress within learning tracks.
    *   **Database:**
        *   Design and implement database schemas for storing learning track definitions, user progress, and assessment results.

### Phase 5: Testing, Deployment, and Iteration (Ongoing)

*   Supabase will be used as the primary data store and authentication service.

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

*   **Complexity of Rich Component Integration:**
    *   *Mitigation:* Start with a few core components, iterate, and maintain clear AG-UI contracts.
*   **AI Agent Performance/Accuracy:**
    *   *Mitigation:* Rigorous testing of AI agents, continuous fine-tuning, and clear feedback mechanisms for users.
*   **Temporal.io Learning Curve:**
    *   *Mitigation:* Dedicated time for team to learn Temporal, start with simpler workflows.
*   **Integration Challenges between Components:**
    *   *Mitigation:* Clear API definitions, regular integration testing, and strong architectural oversight.
*   **Scope Creep:**
    *   *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to PRD and phased implementation, with clear change management processes.

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for building the ITS. It will be a living document, subject to adjustments as the project progresses and new information becomes available.
