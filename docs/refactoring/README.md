# Frontend Refactoring Project

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive refactoring plan for modernizing the Tutor AI frontend application using Next.js 15 + React 19 patterns with Test-Driven Development approach.

## Project Goals
- Refactor monolithic AITutorChat component (535+ lines) using modern patterns
- Implement Next.js 15 Server Components and React 19 hooks
- Establish feature-based architecture
- Improve performance and maintainability
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage

## Quick Start

### 1. Review the Main Task List
Start with [`tasklist.md`](./tasklist.md) for the complete overview of all 19 tasks organized by EPICs.

### 2. Begin with Foundation Tasks
The critical path starts with these foundation tasks:
- [TASK-001: Setup Testing Infrastructure](./tasks/task_001.md)
- [TASK-002: Baseline Testing](./tasks/task_002.md) 
- [TASK-003: Feature-Based Directory Structure](./tasks/task_003.md)
- [TASK-004: Install and Configure Zustand](./tasks/task_004.md)

### 3. Follow the Implementation Order
Tasks are designed to be completed in dependency order as outlined in the main tasklist.

## Architecture Overview

### Current Problems
- **Monolithic Components**: AITutorChat component with 535+ lines
- **All Client Components**: Not leveraging Server Components
- **Complex Local State**: Manual state management everywhere
- **Prop Drilling**: State passed through multiple layers
- **Missing Modern Patterns**: Not using React 19 or Next.js 15 features

### Target Architecture
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Components organized by domain
- **Server Components First**: Leverage Next.js 15 patterns
- **React 19 Hooks**: useActionState, useOptimistic for modern state management
- **Zustand for Global State**: Lightweight, performant state management
- **Server Actions**: Replace client-side API calls

## Epic Breakdown

### EPIC 1: Foundation & Setup (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish testing infrastructure and project organization
- Testing setup (Vitest, Playwright)
- Baseline testing of existing components
- Feature-based directory restructure
- Zustand installation and configuration

### EPIC 2: Component Decomposition (Week 2-3)
**Goal**: Break down monolithic components using TDD
- Extract chat container components
- Implement React 19 useActionState patterns
- Add useOptimistic for better UX
- Convert appropriate components to Server Components

### EPIC 3: State Management Migration (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Replace complex local state with modern patterns
- Migrate chat state to Zustand
- Create learning progress store
- Implement custom hooks for business logic

### EPIC 4: Server Actions & API Integration (Week 4-5)
**Goal**: Modernize API integration using Next.js 15 patterns
- Implement Server Actions for FastAPI integration
- Add request/response validation
- Implement intelligent caching strategies

### EPIC 5: Performance & Testing (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Optimize performance and add comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization using React 19 features
- Comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright
- Accessibility and mobile optimization

### EPIC 6: Documentation & Deployment (Week 6-7)
**Goal**: Complete documentation and monitoring
- Update architecture documentation
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Team training and knowledge transfer

## Key Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Write tests first** for all new functionality
- **Maintain >80% coverage** for business logic
- **Use E2E tests** to validate user workflows
- **Performance testing** to prevent regressions

### Modern Next.js 15 Patterns
- **Server Components by default** with selective Client Components
- **Server Actions** for form handling and mutations
- **Native fetch with caching** instead of external libraries
- **Feature-based organization** over layer-based

### React 19 Features
- **useActionState** for form state management
- **useOptimistic** for instant UI updates
- **Automatic form handling** with Server Actions
- **Improved error boundaries** and suspense

### Performance First
- **Bundle size optimization** through Server Components
- **Selective re-renders** with proper memoization
- **Intelligent caching** strategies
- **Performance monitoring** and alerting

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Starting Any Task
1. **Read the full task description** including acceptance criteria
2. **Check dependencies** - ensure prerequisite tasks are complete
3. **Set up your development environment** according to task requirements
4. **Write tests first** following TDD methodology

### During Implementation
1. **Follow the TDD cycle**: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor
2. **Make small, incremental changes** that can be easily reviewed
3. **Update tests** as you implement features
4. **Document decisions** and any deviations from the plan

### After Completing a Task
1. **Run the full test suite** to ensure no regressions
2. **Update the task status** in tasklist.md
3. **Create a pull request** with clear description of changes
4. **Update any dependent tasks** if needed

## Status Tracking

- **Large scope**: 19 tasks across 6 EPICs requires careful coordination
- **Complex refactoring**: Monolithic component has many interdependencies
- **New patterns**: Team learning curve for React 19 and Next.js 15

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental approach**: TDD ensures small, safe changes
- **Comprehensive testing**: Prevents regressions during refactoring
- **Feature flags**: Allow gradual rollout and easy rollback
- **Pair programming**: Share knowledge and reduce risk

## Next Steps

1. **Review the complete [`tasklist.md`](./tasklist.md)**
2. **Start with [TASK-001](./tasks/task_001.md)** to establish testing foundation
3. **Set up development environment** according to task requirements
4. **Begin TDD implementation** following task acceptance criteria
