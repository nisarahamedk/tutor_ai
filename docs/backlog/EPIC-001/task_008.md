# Task Overview
This task involves setting up an initial Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions (or a similar tool). The pipeline will, at a minimum, run linters (e.g., flake8, black) and execute basic backend unit tests (e.g., for the health check endpoint from Task 1.3) on every push. Additionally, the backend FastAPI application will be containerized using Docker, and a `docker-compose.yml` file will be created for easier local development setup.

## Business Context
Automated CI/CD pipelines and containerization are crucial for modern software development. CI ensures code quality and catches regressions early. Containerization provides consistent development and deployment environments. Implementing these early streamlines development workflows, improves code reliability, and prepares the application for future deployments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows/`) is created.
- [ ] The CI pipeline is triggered on pushes to main branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`) and pull requests.
- [ ] The CI pipeline executes:
  - Python code linting (e.g., flake8, black).
  - Python unit tests (e.g., using `pytest`).
- [ ] CI pipeline status (pass/fail) is visible (e.g., badges in README, PR checks).
- [ ] A `Dockerfile` is created for the backend FastAPI application.
  - [ ] Docker image builds successfully.
  - [ ] Docker image can run the FastAPI application.
- [ ] A `docker-compose.yml` file is created at the repository root (or other sensible location).
  - [ ] `docker-compose up` successfully starts the backend service using the Dockerfile.
  - [ ] (Optional, advanced) `docker-compose.yml` includes stubs for other services like Supabase (local dev instance) or Temporal for a more complete local environment, though full setup of these might be deferred. For this task, focus on the backend service.
- [ ] Documentation on how to use the Docker setup for local development is added to `README.md` or a development guide.

## Service Layer TDD Approach
### Test Strategy
- **CI Pipeline:** The "test" for the CI pipeline is its successful execution and correct reporting of linting/test failures.
- **Dockerfile:** Tested by successfully building the image and running a container that serves the application.
- **docker-compose.yml:** Tested by `docker-compose up` successfully launching the backend service, which becomes accessible.

### Key Test Scenarios
- CI pipeline runs on a PR and correctly identifies linting errors if introduced.
- CI pipeline runs on a PR and correctly identifies failing unit tests if introduced.
- CI pipeline passes if code is clean and tests pass.
- `docker build -t its-backend .` (from backend directory) successfully builds the image.
- `docker run its-backend` starts the FastAPI application, and the `/health` endpoint is accessible.
- `docker-compose up` starts the backend service, and the `/health` endpoint is accessible.

## Technical Specifications
### Service Interface Design
- Not applicable to this CI/CD and containerization task directly.

### Implementation Guidance
- **CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**
  - Use standard actions for setting up Python, installing dependencies (Poetry), running linters, and running pytest.
  - Example workflow triggers: `on: [push, pull_request]`.
- **Dockerfile:**
  - Start from a Python base image (e.g., `python:3.10-slim`).
  - Set up work directory, copy `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
  - Install Poetry and dependencies using `poetry install --no-root --no-dev`.
  - Copy application code.
  - Expose the application port (e.g., 8000).
  - Set the `CMD` to run Uvicorn (e.g., `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`).
- **docker-compose.yml (Version 3.8+):**
  - Define a service for the backend (e.g., `backend_service`).
  - Use `build: ./backend` to specify the Dockerfile location.
  - Map ports (e.g., `8000:8000`).
  - Mount volumes for local development if desired for live reloading (e.g., `./backend/app:/app/app`), though ensure production Dockerfile doesn't rely on this.
  - Manage environment variables (e.g., using `.env` file).

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- **Blocking Dependencies**: `EPIC-001_TASK_3` (Backend Project Setup) is required as the Dockerfile and CI pipeline will operate on this codebase. At least one unit test (e.g., for `/health`) should exist.
- **Contract Dependencies**: None.
- **Parallel Work Opportunities**: Can be developed in parallel with `EPIC-001_TASK_7` (Temporal Setup).
- **Mock Requirements**: No mocks needed for this task.
- **Integration Points**: The CI pipeline will be used for all future code changes. The Docker setup will be the standard way to run the backend locally and potentially for deployment.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CI pipeline is configured, runs automatically, and correctly reports status for linting and tests.
- [ ] Backend `Dockerfile` is created, and the image builds and runs successfully.
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` is created and successfully starts the backend service.
- [ ] Basic documentation for local Docker development environment is provided.
- [ ] Code (workflow files, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml) is reviewed and merged.

## Technical Notes
- Ensure the `.dockerignore` file is present in the `backend/` directory to exclude unnecessary files from the Docker image (e.g., `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`).
- Consider multi-stage Docker builds for smaller production images in the future, but a single-stage build is fine for this initial task.
- The `docker-compose.yml` can be expanded in later tasks to include frontend, Temporal, and Supabase for a full local stack.
