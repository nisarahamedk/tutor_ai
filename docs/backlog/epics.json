      "description": "This epic covers setting up the foundational infrastructure for the ITS, including the frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) project structures, basic database (Supabase) integration, initial Temporal.io setup for chat session management, and a rudimentary chat interface allowing users to send and receive messages. This lays the groundwork for all future development.",

      "title": "Foundation - AI Agent Integration and Basic Tutoring Logic",
      "description": "This epic focuses on integrating the first AI agent into the backend, enabling it to process user messages from the chat interface and generate simple text responses. It includes choosing an AI agent framework, connecting to an LLM, and modifying Temporal workflows to incorporate AI agent calls. Basic content delivery mechanisms will be implemented.",
