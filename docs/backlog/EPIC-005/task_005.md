# Task Overview
This task involves extending the basic CI/CD pipeline (from `EPIC-001_TASK_8`) to include automated build steps, execution of comprehensive test suites (unit, integration), and deployment scripts for staging and production environments. The goal is to enable reliable, automated deployments of both frontend and backend applications to the infrastructure provisioned in `EPIC-005_TASK_4`.

## Business Context
A mature CI/CD pipeline is crucial for rapid, reliable, and repeatable software delivery. Automating testing and deployment reduces manual errors, speeds up release cycles, and allows developers to focus on building features. This task ensures the ITS can be deployed to production efficiently and safely.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is configured with distinct stages for build, test, and deploy.
- [ ] **Build Stage:**
  - Frontend application is built for production.
  - Backend Docker image is built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Artifact Registry).
- [ ] **Test Stage:**
  - Automated unit tests (from Task 5.1) for the backend are executed.
  - Automated integration tests (from Task 5.2) for the backend are executed against a suitable test environment.
  - (Optional, if feasible) Basic E2E tests (from Task 5.3) are triggered.
  - Pipeline fails if any tests fail.
- [ ] **Deploy Stage (Staging):**
  - Scripts are implemented to automatically deploy the new frontend build and backend container image to a staging/test environment.
  - Deployment to staging might be triggered automatically on merges to a `develop` or `staging` branch.
- [ ] **Deploy Stage (Production):**
  - Scripts are implemented to automatically deploy to the production environment.
  - Deployment to production is gated (e.g., requires manual approval, triggered on merges to `main` or tags, successful staging deployment).
- [ ] Secrets and environment variables required for deployment (e.g., container registry credentials, deployment target credentials) are managed securely within the CI/CD system.
- [ ] Rollback strategy or ability to quickly redeploy a previous version is considered and documented (full implementation might be a separate task if complex).

## Service Layer TDD Approach
### Test Strategy
- The CI/CD pipeline itself is "tested" by its successful and correct execution of all stages.
- Deployment scripts can be tested incrementally against staging environments.
- Ensure that test stages correctly report failures and prevent deployment if tests fail.

### Key Test Scenarios (Pipeline Verification)
- A code change that passes all tests is successfully built and deployed to staging.
- A code change that fails unit or integration tests is NOT deployed to staging or production.
- Backend Docker image is correctly tagged (e.g., with Git commit SHA or version number) and pushed to the registry.
- Frontend assets are correctly deployed to their hosting platform.
- Environment variables are correctly applied to the deployed applications in staging/production.
- Manual approval step for production deployment functions correctly (if implemented).

## Technical Specifications
### Service Interface Design
- Not applicable directly, but the pipeline orchestrates deployment of services with their defined interfaces.

### Implementation Guidance
- **GitHub Actions (or chosen CI/CD tool):**
  - Use workflows with multiple jobs for different stages.
  - Utilize environment protection rules for production deployment (e.g., required reviewers, wait timers).
  - Store secrets (API keys, registry passwords) in GitHub Actions secrets.
- **Deployment Scripts:**
  - For frontend (e.g., Vercel/Netlify): Often handled by CLI tools provided by the platform or direct Git integration.
  - For backend (containerized): Scripts might use `docker` CLI, `kubectl` (if Kubernetes), or platform-specific CLIs (e.g., `aws ecs deploy`, `gcloud run deploy`).
- **Container Registry:** Choose a registry and configure authentication for pushing images from CI.
- **Environment Configuration:** Use the CI/CD system's capabilities to manage different environment configurations for staging and production (e.g., different Supabase URLs, different LLM API keys if tiered).
- **Notifications:** Configure CI/CD pipeline to send notifications (e.g., Slack, email) on build/deployment success or failure.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- **Blocking Dependencies**:
  - `EPIC-001_TASK_8` (Basic CI/CD Pipeline) - provides the initial pipeline to extend.
  - `EPIC-005_TASK_4` (Production Infrastructure Setup) - need environments to deploy to.
  - Completion of test suites (`EPIC-005_TASK_1`, `EPIC-005_TASK_2`, potentially `EPIC-005_TASK_3`) is crucial for the "test" stage to be meaningful.
- **Contract Dependencies**: None.
- **Parallel Work Opportunities**: Can be developed once the infrastructure targets are known and basic application images/builds are available.
- **Mock Requirements**: Not typically applicable, as this task deals with real deployments, though initial script development might use "dry run" modes if available.
- **Integration Points**: This pipeline integrates with source control (triggers), testing frameworks, container registries, and the hosting infrastructure.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline automatically builds, tests (unit & integration), and deploys frontend and backend to a staging environment.
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline can deploy (with appropriate gates) to the production environment.
- [ ] Secrets are managed securely.
- [ ] Pipeline reliably reports success/failure of each stage.
- [ ] Basic deployment documentation (how to trigger, monitor) is available.
- [ ] Code (workflow files, deployment scripts) is reviewed and merged.

## Technical Notes
- Start with deploying to a staging environment to iron out kinks before configuring production deployment.
- Keep deployment scripts idempotent where possible (running them multiple times has the same effect).
- Consider blue/green deployments or canary releases for production in the future for zero-downtime updates (more advanced). For now, a simpler overwrite or recreate deployment is acceptable.
- Thoroughly test the production deployment process in a controlled manner.
