# Task Overview
This task involves creating initial technical documentation for the Intelligent Tutoring System. This documentation should cover a high-level system architecture overview (summarizing `architecture.md`), key components and their roles, basic setup instructions for new developers (e.g., how to run the system locally using Docker Compose), and pointers to important codebase locations or further resources.

## Business Context
Good documentation is essential for project maintainability, onboarding new team members, and ensuring knowledge continuity. Clear, concise technical documentation helps developers understand the system quickly, reduces ramp-up time, and facilitates troubleshooting and future development efforts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A `README.md` at the root of the `docs/backlog/` or a main project `README.md` is updated or created to explain the backlog structure and purpose.
- [ ] A new document (e.g., `docs/system_overview.md` or updates to the main project `README.md`) is created containing:
  - A brief summary of the system's purpose and architecture (can reference `architecture.md`).
  - An overview of the key components (Frontend, Backend API, AI Agents, Temporal Workflows, Supabase DB) and their primary responsibilities.
  - High-level data flow for key interactions (e.g., user sends message, AI responds).
- [ ] A section or separate document (e.g., `docs/developer_setup.md`) provides clear instructions for new developers on how to:
  - Clone the repository.
  - Install prerequisites (e.g., Docker, Node.js, Poetry).
  - Configure local environment variables (referencing `.env.example` files).
  - Run the entire system locally (e.g., using the `docker-compose.yml` from `EPIC-001_TASK_8`).
  - Run linters and tests.
- [ ] Pointers to key contract documents (API specs, AG-UI events, data models) are included.
- [ ] Documentation is written in clear, concise language suitable for technical team members.

## Service Layer TDD Approach
### Test Strategy
- Documentation is "tested" by its clarity, accuracy, and usefulness.
- This involves peer review by other developers to see if they can understand the system and set up their environment using the documentation.

### Key Test Scenarios (for Documentation Review)
- Can a new developer successfully set up and run the project locally by following the `developer_setup.md`?
- Does the `system_overview.md` provide a clear understanding of how the major components interact?
- Is it easy to find where key contracts or more detailed architectural information is located?
- Is the documentation up-to-date with the current state of the project (as of end of EPIC-004 features)?

## Technical Specifications
### Service Interface Design
- Not applicable directly.

### Implementation Guidance
- **Structure:**
  - Consider a main `README.md` in `docs/` that links to more specific documents.
  - `system_overview.md`: Keep it high-level. Use diagrams if helpful (e.g., Mermaid syntax if supported, or link to images). Reference `architecture.md` for deeper dives.
  - `developer_setup.md`: Provide step-by-step commands. Include troubleshooting tips for common setup issues if known.
- **Content:**
  - Reuse information from `architecture.md` and `implementation_plan.md` where appropriate, but summarize and tailor for these specific documentation goals.
  - Focus on practical information that developers need.
- **Maintenance:** Stress that this is initial documentation and will need to be updated as the system evolves.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- **Blocking Dependencies**: `EPIC-004/8` (Core system features are largely complete and stable, so architecture is settled). `EPIC-001_TASK_8` (Backend Containerization and `docker-compose.yml`) is needed for local setup instructions.
- **Contract Dependencies**: None directly, but will reference other contract documents.
- **Parallel Work Opportunities**: Can be done during the final stages of testing and bug fixing.
- **Mock Requirements**: Not applicable.
- **Integration Points**: This documentation integrates knowledge from all parts of the project.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] `system_overview.md` (or equivalent) is created and populated.
- [ ] `developer_setup.md` (or equivalent) is created with clear local setup instructions.
- [ ] Main project `README.md` or `docs/README.md` is updated to guide users to this documentation.
- [ ] Documentation is reviewed by at least one other team member for clarity and accuracy.
- [ ] Documentation files are committed to the repository.

## Technical Notes
- Good documentation is a living thing. This task creates the initial baseline.
- Encourage diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid in Markdown) for illustrating architecture and flows.
- Ensure any setup scripts or commands provided in the documentation are tested and work correctly.
