# Task Overview
This task involves integrating structured logging throughout the backend application (FastAPI, Temporal activities/workflows, AI agents) and setting up basic monitoring dashboards. The goal is to gain visibility into the system's health, performance, and error rates in staging and production environments. This includes capturing key metrics and logs that can help diagnose issues and understand system behavior.

## Business Context
Effective logging and monitoring are essential for maintaining a healthy production application. They provide the insights needed to detect problems proactively, diagnose issues when they occur, understand system performance, and make data-driven decisions for improvements and scaling. Without them, operating a live system is like flying blind.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Structured Logging (Backend):**
  - Implement structured logging (e.g., using `loguru` or standard Python `logging` with JSON formatter) in the FastAPI application, Temporal workers (workflows/activities), and AI agent code.
  - Logs should include relevant context (e.g., timestamp, log level, service name, function name, user ID if applicable, correlation IDs).
  - Key events, errors, and significant operations are logged.
- [ ] **Log Aggregation (Basic):**
  - Logs from deployed backend components are collected and viewable in a centralized location (e.g., cloud provider's logging service like AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, or a simple setup with a log management tool if feasible).
- [ ] **Basic Monitoring Dashboards:**
  - Set up basic dashboards to monitor key system health metrics. This could use:
    - Supabase built-in monitoring (for database metrics).
    - Temporal Web UI or Temporal Cloud observability features (for workflow execution counts, error rates, latencies).
    - Cloud provider metrics for backend hosting (e.g., CPU/memory utilization, request count, error rates for API).
    - Frontend monitoring (e.g., Vercel/Netlify analytics for page views, errors - if available and simple to enable).
- [ ] **Alerting (Minimal Viable):**
  - Set up at least one basic alert for a critical condition (e.g., high rate of 5xx errors on the backend API, significant number of Temporal workflow failures).
- [ ] Documentation on where to find logs and how to access monitoring dashboards is created.

## Service Layer TDD Approach
### Test Strategy
- **Logging Implementation:** Code reviews to ensure important events/errors are logged with sufficient context. For critical logging, unit tests could assert that a logger method was called (using mocks).
- **Monitoring/Alerting Setup:** Tested by verifying that dashboards display data from deployed (staging) services and that test alerts are triggered when conditions are met.

### Key Test Scenarios
- **Logging:**
  - When an API endpoint encounters an error, an error log with relevant details (e.g., request ID, error message) is generated.
  - A Temporal workflow starting or failing logs this event.
  - AI agent making a call to an LLM logs the attempt and outcome (success/failure).
- **Monitoring:**
  - Backend API request rate and error rate dashboard correctly displays data from the staging environment.
  - Temporal workflow execution dashboard shows recent workflow runs.
- **Alerting:**
  - Trigger a condition that should fire an alert (e.g., manually cause a spike in API errors in staging) and verify the alert is received.

## Technical Specifications
### Service Interface Design
- Not applicable directly.

### Implementation Guidance
- **Structured Logging:**
  - Choose a logging library (e.g., `loguru` for ease of use in Python, or configure standard `logging`).
  - Define a consistent log format (JSON is good for machine readability and log management systems).
  - Add meaningful log statements at critical points: application startup, API request handling (entry/exit, errors), service calls, workflow/activity execution, external API calls (like to LLMs).
  - Be mindful of logging sensitive information (PII); scrub or avoid logging it.
- **Log Aggregation:**
  - For containerized backend services, configure Docker logging driver to send logs to the cloud provider's logging service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging).
  - Supabase and Temporal Cloud often provide their own log viewing capabilities.
- **Monitoring Dashboards:**
  - Utilize built-in dashboarding features of your cloud provider, Supabase, and Temporal.
  - Focus on key metrics: request latency, error rates, resource utilization, workflow success/failure rates.
- **Alerting:**
  - Use alerting features of your cloud provider or monitoring tools. Start with simple, high-impact alerts.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- **Blocking Dependencies**: `EPIC-005_TASK_5` (Finalize CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Deployments), as logging and monitoring are typically set up on deployed applications in staging/production environments.
- **Contract Dependencies**: None.
- **Parallel Work Opportunities**: Can be implemented once applications are deployable to a stable staging environment.
- **Mock Requirements**: Not typically for implementation, but for testing alert conditions, you might need to simulate error states.
- **Integration Points**: Integrates with all deployed application components (FE, BE, Temporal) and the underlying infrastructure/cloud services.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Structured logging is implemented in key backend components.
- [ ] Basic log aggregation allows viewing logs from deployed services.
- [ ] Basic monitoring dashboards for key metrics are set up and functional.
- [ ] At least one critical alert is configured and tested.
- [ ] Documentation on accessing logs/dashboards is available.
- [ ] Code (logging configurations, IaC for monitoring if any) is reviewed and merged.

## Technical Notes
- This is a foundational step for observability. More advanced monitoring (distributed tracing, APM tools like Datadog, New Relic) can be considered later based on needs and budget.
- Start simple and iterate. Get basic logs and metrics flowing first, then refine.
- Ensure log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) are used appropriately to control log verbosity in different environments.
- Regularly review logs and dashboards to understand system behavior and identify potential issues.
