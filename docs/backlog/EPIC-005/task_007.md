# Task Overview
This task involves organizing and conducting an internal usability testing session. Team members (e.g., developers, QA, product manager, or even colleagues unfamiliar with the project) will act as users and walk through the core user journeys of the Intelligent Tutoring System. The goal is to gather qualitative feedback on UI/UX clarity, ease of use, intuitiveness of interactions, and overall user experience before wider release.

## Business Context
Usability testing, even with internal participants, is a cost-effective way to identify major usability issues and areas of confusion before real users encounter them. Early feedback on user experience can lead to significant improvements, increasing user satisfaction, engagement, and adoption.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A usability testing plan is created:
  - Defines 2-3 core user journeys to test (e.g., signup & first chat, finding & starting a learning track, interacting with a rich component).
  - Identifies target internal participants (3-5 users is often sufficient for initial feedback).
  - Outlines tasks for participants to perform.
  - Specifies data to be collected (e.g., observations, think-aloud comments, post-session questionnaire responses).
- [ ] Internal usability testing sessions are conducted with the selected participants using a deployed staging version of the application.
  - One facilitator guides the session and observes.
  - Participants are encouraged to "think aloud" as they perform tasks.
- [ ] Feedback from the sessions is collected and summarized.
  - Key pain points, areas of confusion, and positive feedback are documented.
- [ ] A brief report or list of actionable usability improvement suggestions is created and shared with the team.

## Service Layer TDD Approach
### Test Strategy
- This is a qualitative UX testing method, not directly related to service-layer TDD of code.
- The "test" is on the overall user experience and design.

### Key Test Scenarios (User Journeys for Testing)
- **Journey 1: Onboarding and First Interaction**
  - Task: Sign up for a new account.
  - Task: Log in.
  - Task: Navigate to the chat interface.
  - Task: Send a first message to the AI tutor and observe the response.
- **Journey 2: Learning Track Engagement**
  - Task: Find the list of available learning tracks.
  - Task: Choose and start a specific learning track.
  - Task: Navigate to the first unit of the track.
  - Task: Interact with the content of the first unit (e.g., read text, answer a simple question if presented).
- **Journey 3: Rich Component Interaction**
  - Task: (Within a chat or learning track unit) Encounter and interact with a specific rich component (e.g., an MCQ or a slider).
  - Task: Understand how to use the component and submit input.
  - Task: Observe the system's response after the interaction.

## Technical Specifications
### Service Interface Design
- Not applicable directly. Focus is on the user interface and overall flow.

### Implementation Guidance
- **Preparation:**
  - Ensure the staging environment is stable and populated with any necessary test data (e.g., sample learning tracks, user accounts if not created during test).
  - Prepare a brief script for the facilitator to introduce the session and guide participants.
  - If using a questionnaire, prepare it in advance (e.g., using Google Forms).
- **Execution:**
  - Sessions can be done in person or remotely (screen sharing).
  - Record sessions (with permission) for later review if possible.
  - Emphasize to participants that you are testing the system, not them.
  - Avoid leading questions or helping the participant unless they are completely stuck.
- **Analysis:**
  - After sessions, collate notes and observations.
  - Look for recurring themes or critical issues.
  - Prioritize feedback based on severity and impact on user experience.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- **Blocking Dependencies**:
  - `EPIC-005_TASK_3` (E2E Tests imply system is stable enough for walkthroughs).
  - `EPIC-005_TASK_6` (Logging and Monitoring, implying a deployed and somewhat stable staging environment is available).
  - A feature-complete or near feature-complete version of the application deployed to a staging environment.
- **Contract Dependencies**: None.
- **Parallel Work Opportunities**: Can be done while final bug fixes or minor polishes are happening before a production release candidate is prepared.
- **Mock Requirements**: The system should be using real (or realistic test/staging) backend services. Deep backend mocks would defeat the purpose of UX testing the integrated system.
- **Integration Points**: This task tests the usability of the entire integrated application as experienced by a user.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Usability testing plan is created.
- [ ] Testing sessions are conducted with at least 3 internal users.
- [ ] Feedback is collected, summarized, and documented.
- [ ] A short list of actionable improvement suggestions is produced.

## Technical Notes
- Internal usability testing is not a replacement for testing with real target users, but it's a valuable first step.
- Keep the scope of tasks manageable for participants within a reasonable session time (e.g., 30-60 minutes).
- The output of this task is primarily qualitative feedback to inform final UI/UX tweaks before launch or for the next iteration. It may lead to new small tasks being created.
